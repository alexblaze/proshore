## Redux Store

The app uses Redux to manage the state. The Redux store contains the following state slices:

- `spellData`: Manages the data related to spells, including the list of all spells, favorite spells, and the currently viewed single spell.

## Redux Actions

The app defines several Redux actions to interact with the store:

- `fetchAllSpells`: Fetches all spells from the API and updates the store.
- `fetchSingleSpell`: Fetches a single spell based on its index and updates the store.
- `setLoading`: Updates the loading status in the store.
- `addToFavorites`: Adds a spell to the list of favorites.
- `removeFromFavorites`: Removes a spell from the list of favorites.

## API Integration

The app uses an API to fetch spell data. The API provides a list of spells with their details, which is used to populate the app's data.

## Technologies Used

- React: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- TypeScript: Adds type safety to JavaScript code.
- Redux: State management library for React apps.
- React Router: Handles navigation and routing in the app.
- Redux Thunk: Middleware for asynchronous actions in Redux.
- Tailwind CSS: Utility-first CSS framework for styling the app.

## Credits

This app is inspired by the Dungeons & Dragons spell system. The spell data used in the app is fetched from an external API, which provides a list of spells and their details.
